# CartoonCharacters
An application that parses in Wikipedia cartoon characters and shows on the screen. (You can also save your favorites in the CoreDate).

The application uses the Wikipedia API (Receives Muppet character), and shows the information on the screen. It's also easy to save any character in the "favorites" and remove from there. You can filter by all characters and separately by favorites. And from the screen of detailed information about the character, by clicking on the button - opens "Safari" with a full description of the character on the site. (The application supports all orientations and is written without the use of storyboard).
